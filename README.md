This supplementary material summarizes the analysis conducted for the manuscript “Maximizing surgical success in epilepsy: seizure-onset zone resection is crucial, while extending beyond offers no added benefit .” 

Instructions: Each results section contains the corresponding computation code chunk. All code chunks and printed messages are folded by default. They can be unfolded to see the details. This provides a more coherent way of presenting results and code together. Highlighted text is in orange, and hyperlinks to references and sections are in light blue.
